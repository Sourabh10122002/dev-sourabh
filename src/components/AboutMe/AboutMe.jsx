              I'm a User Experience/Interface Designer focused on Visual Design
              for websites and mobile apps. Currently working as UX/UI designer
              at Grarri Private Limited. By continuously learning, practicing
              and reflecting, I seek to create simple and aesthetic interactive
              experiences. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,
              beautiful and intuitive designs.
            </p>

              Apart from designing, I also enjoy building websites and playing
              with CSS animation. On Instagram, we have a community of 10K+
              designers, where I help them with UI/UX Design and Web
              Development. I also share UI/UX tutorials and tips. So when I'm
              not pushing pixels, you'll find me scrolling through my Instagram
              or Twitter feed.
